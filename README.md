As the midterms are at an end and newly appointed Congresswomen and men are getting ready to settle into their new seats, we cannot forget all the congressional resignations that have come in the 115th Congress Class.Our dataset lists every Congressman and woman to resign between the 57th Congress in 1901 and the current 115th Congress in January 2018. Our intent is to predict who the next Congressmember to retire will be.
