## Project Description

#### As the midterms are at an end and newly appointed Congresswomen and men are getting ready to settle into their new seats, we can't forget all the congressional resignations that have come in the 115th Congress Class. At this point in history, we have had the most people resign from Congress through this point in the session in at least 117 years. In fact, for the better part of the last century, we had seen a decline in congressional resignations.^1^  Seeing a rise and fall of congressional retirements through the years has a tendency to give way to a few trends, more poignantly, historical events.^2^ The reasons congressional leaders have retired, their party alliance, and what state they represent are all factors that can cause pressure for a resignation based on the wants of the people that elected them, and how it'll make the political party look.^3^ Of course, all of these variables can stand independently of each other, but what if I told you we could play a game of Guess Who, using variables such as these **to predict which member of Congress will resign next?**

#### This can be based on the statistical trends we have seen throughout the last 120 years of Congress while taking into consideration historical events in the past and for our present. We will be utilizing FiveThirtyEight's congressional resignations dataset, which covers resignations, meaning mid-session resignations, not retirements at the end of a regularly scheduled term, even if their reasons for retirement are scandalous(looking at you Ruben Kihuen). By using linear regressions and K Nearest Neighbors methods, this will use the majority class or average value to predict for each observation. This dataset contains information about the 615 members of Congress who resigned or were removed from office from March 4, 1901 (the first day of the 57th Congress) through January 15, 2018, including the resigning member’s party and district, the date they resigned, the reason for their resignation and the media source of the information about their resignation. The reasons why the Congressional member resigned is given in detail, as well as sorted into categories depending on the reason.

### Reasons for Resigning

Code | Category
---- | -------------
X    | Unwanted sexual contact 
A    | Consensual sex scandals 
B    | Other Scandals
C    | Elected to Another office - this can surge during election seasons
E    | Health/Family - non-scandalous personal matters
F    | Other - a non-scandal reason e.g. deciding to run in opposing party
G    | Left early - by choice, usually to let successor start early
H    | Military Service - whether by draft or choice
I    | Election Overturned - contested election, ultimately losing the seat

#### The target audience of our project is for those who are politically aware of the government that is elected today. We will be providing our analysis based on only a few variables, and they hardly paint the whole picture of Congress. Someone who is up-to-date on current events can utilize our findings to draw even more conclusions of their own with historical event congruences, gender probabilities, how resignations have affected policy, and even about how the Congressional trends have affected their own state. We want our audience to learn about the elected officials that have resigned and why. We want our audience to understand who is representing them. 

## Technical Description

#### The format of our final web source will be a Jupyter Notebook HTML complied webpage. A data management challenge for us lies within the Category column. There are some Congressional members that resigned for multiple reasons, resulting in the Category column appearing as "E&F", for example. We will need to separate this data and find a way to categorize them that does not result in doubling up the data provided. We will need to familiarize ourselves with K Nearest Data Machine Learning algorithms a bit more, and understanding if this is the best fit for the model we desire to create. We will also need to familiarize ourselves with Git Bash and merging our branches when dealing with multiple partners. **Add technical detailed description here**
