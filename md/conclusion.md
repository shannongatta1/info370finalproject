## Conclusion

Despite having some limitations in the lack of features that were given, we were happy to see that we were able to predict with a satisfactory accuracy score of 76%  based on factors such as endorsements, office type, STEM, LGBTQ, and party support, which supported our original hypothesis that some of the given factors would be able to give us an idea of whether a democratic candidate would advance. All three of our models systematically chose `'Yes_Endorsements'`, `'No_Endorsements'`, and `'Party_Support_Yes'` as features, so perhaps those categories are more significant election predictors, at least for now. With the increasing attention to technology and LGBTQ rights, factors such as STEM and LGBTQ were not a surprise to us although these might not have been as important in past elections. Overall, this model and findings can help people who are politically active or want a better understanding of the political environment of which factors may be important to democrats when voting for candidates.
