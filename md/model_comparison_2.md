The following three graphs depicted compare the number of accurate and inaccurate matches of each model used to predict and the outcomes. We can see that:

- The algorithms show a consistent pattern of more accurately predicting the candidates who lost the primary. KNN predicted 88.8% of the total losses, and Random Forest was the best at 94.1%. Logistic regression followed this trend as well, predicting 92.3% of the candidates who lost.
- The models didn't follow the same ranking of accuracy for the candidates who won. KNN was still the lowest, predicting 62.2% of the total wins. However, Random Forest only predicted 66.2% while logistic predicted 67.6%. 

Note:  these predictions are for 30% of our dataset, so the total is out of 244 candidates.
