In the stacked bar chart that groups by Primary Status and shows the percentages of each for each bar, **59.2%** of the **advanced** candidates were _white_, **23.8** were _nonwhite_, and **17.0%** were _unknown_. Since these proportions are not equal the overall makeup, race could be an influential factor on the primary status of a candidate. At the same time, these proportions are not that far off from the overall makeup proportions, and therefore may be a less defining factor when predicting whether a candidate advanced.To see this in a different way, the stacked bar chart that groups first by race and stacks by primary status shows that the percentage of white that advanced is higher than any other race category that advanced.
