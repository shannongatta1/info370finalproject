In the stacked bar chart that groups by Primary Status and shows the percentages of each for each bar, 59.2% of the advanced candidates were white, 23.8% were nonwhite, and 17.0% were unknown. Since these proportions are not equal the overall makeup, race could be an influential factor on the primary status of a candidate. To see this in a different way, the stacked bar chart that groups first by race and stacks by primary status shows that the percentage of white that advanced is higher than any other race category that advanced.
