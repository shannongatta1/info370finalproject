## Meet Out Models

We used three different models to try and predict our outcome - one statistical model, and two machine learning algorithms. With each having their own strengths and weaknesses, it was important to evaluate different ones to find the best model for our data. For each one, we took our 811 candidate observations and split the data 70/30. 70% was used to train the model, and 30% was used to test and see how accurately we could predict a win or a loss.
