### Race

Even though it's 2018, race is still an issue our country is grappling with. While our communities may be more inclusive, in a sense, each of us still promote unconscious biases or particular behaviors that we probably shouldn't be. Within the political arena, it's still big news whenever a person of color manages to get elected. This is progress, but it shows that it's still not the norm for minorities to win a position. As such, it was important to investigate the role race plays in elections.


First, it should be noted that 32% of all candidates advanced. Therefore, if race was not related to the likelihood that a candidate advances, then 32% of each race group (White, nonwhite, and unknown) would advance. To look at the overall makeup of the candidates, the pie chart shows that 55.7% of the candidates are white, 19.2% are nonwhite, and 25% are unknown.
