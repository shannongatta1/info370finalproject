### Race

Based on the findings, it is first determined that 32% of all candidates advanced. Therefore, if race was not related to the likelihood that a candidate advances, then 32% of each race group (White, nonwhite, and unknown) would advance. To look at the overall makeup of the candidates, the pie chart shows that 55.7% of the candidates are white, 19.2% are nonwhite, and 25% are unknown.
