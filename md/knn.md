## K-Nearest Neighbors

By using the KNN Regressor, the target is predicted by local interpolation of the targets associated with the nearest neighbors in the training set. We used grid search to cross validate and assess the accuracy of each possible model. For the grid search we used the n_neighbors which determines the amount of neighbors the KNN model should look at. We also used KNN's weight parameter to determine if points should either be weighted uniformly or by their distance from the target point. Using the auto parameter of the KNN algorithm lets it determine which type of algorithm to use when computing nearest neighbors. Our last parameter is the leaf_size which determines how many endpoints the KNN tree will have. Outside of the KNN regressor we use selectkbest to determine the best features to include in the algorithm based on their regression scores from f_regression. This model also uses a MinMaxScaler for scaling the data between 0 and 1.
